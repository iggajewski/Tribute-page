      <h2>What are they?</h2>
      <p>The red fox (<i>Vulpes vulpes</i>) is the largest of the true foxes and one of the most widely distributed members of the order <i>Carnivora</i>, being present across the entire Northern Hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to North Africa, North America and Eurasia. The red fox originated from smaller-sized ancestors from Eurasia during the Middle Villafranchian period, and colonised North America shortly after the Wisconsin glaciation. Among the true foxes, the red fox represents a more progressive form in the direction of carnivory. Apart from its large size, the red fox is distinguished from other fox species by its ability to adapt quickly to new environments. Despite its name, the species often produces individuals with other colourings, including leucistic and melanistic individuals. Forty-five subspecies are currently recognised, which are divided into two categories: the large northern foxes, and the small, basal southern foxes of Asia and North Africa.</p>

      <h2>What do they look like?</h2>
      <p>Red foxes are the largest species of the genus <i>Vulpes</i>. However, relative to dimensions, red foxes are much lighter than similarly sized dogs of the genus <i>Canis</i>. The red fox has an elongated body and relatively short limbs. They display significant individual, sexual, age and geographical variation in size. On average, adults measure 35–50 cm high at the shoulder and 45–90 cm in body length with tails measuring 30–55.5 cm. The tail, which is longer than half the body length (70 per cent of head and body length), is fluffy and reaches the ground when in a standing position. The forepaws have five digits, while the hind feet have only four and lack dewclaws. They are very agile, being capable of jumping over 2-metre-high (6 ft 7 in) fences, and swim well.</p>

      <h2>Behavior: what are they like?</h2>
      <p>Red foxes live in family groups sharing a joint territory. Red foxes either establish stable home ranges within particular areas or are itinerant with no fixed abode. They use their urine to mark their territories. Red foxes reproduce once a year in spring. Outside the breeding season, most red foxes favour living in the open, in densely vegetated areas, though they may enter burrows to escape bad weather.</p>

      <h2>How do they communicate?</h2>
      <p >Red fox body language consists of movements of the ears, tail and postures, with their body markings emphasising certain gestures. Postures can be divided into aggressive/dominant and fearful/submissive categories. Some postures may blend the two together. Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick their ears whilst sniffing. Playful individuals will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, and raise their tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails back and forth with their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. Red foxes have a wide vocal range, and produce different sounds spanning five octaves, which grade into each other. Recent analyses identify 12 different sounds produced by adults and 8 by kits. The majority of sounds can be divided into <b>contact</b> and <b>interaction</b> calls. The former vary according to the distance between individuals, while the latter vary according to the level of aggression.
